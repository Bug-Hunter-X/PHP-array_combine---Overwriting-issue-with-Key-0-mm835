This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP's `array_combine()` function when dealing with array keys that evaluate to 0.  The `bug.php` file shows the problem. The `bugSolution.php` file illustrates ways to address it. The core issue arises from how `array_combine()` handles numeric keys, potentially leading to unintended data overwriting.  The solution involves checking for and handling the 0 key explicitly.
