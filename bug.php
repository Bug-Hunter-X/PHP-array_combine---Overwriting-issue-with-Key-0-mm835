This code suffers from a subtle bug related to how PHP handles array keys.  If `$someArray` contains a key that is equal to 0, it won't be overwritten correctly with the value from `$newValue` in the `array_combine()` function.  `array_combine()` uses the values from `$keys` as keys, and if the first element is 0,  the subsequent elements will have numeric keys starting from 1. This can overwrite other values unexpectedly if there are existing keys with those indices.
